# Dashboard with HTML
This is a simple dashboard built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I did this as a way to build some confidence in my HTML. I am building this with no frameworks, just HTML,
CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 

## Possible use cases
This dashboard can be used for many purposed, tweaked to fit each of them:
üçí A dashboard for a simple fintech dashboard. Eg: Savings platforms, etc
üçâ A dashboard for a health tracking system (Don't mind the 'Pricing' and 'Income' components in the dashboard, they cam all be changed to fit your preference).

## PS
I can't finish this without fully acknowledging youtube during the process. As much as I love all things tech and coding, its really crucial to solidify your knowledge of
everything you learn.

Thanks and I hope you make use of this as a base to start awesome thingsüòâ.
